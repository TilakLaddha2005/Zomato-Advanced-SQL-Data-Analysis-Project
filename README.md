# Zomato-Advanced-SQL-Data-Analysis-Project

A complete SQL-based analytics project on a Zomato-style food delivery platform with database schema, mock data, and 20+ real-world SQL queries for business insights and customer behavior analysis.

---

##  Project Structure

This project uses mock data across five key entities:

| Table       | Description                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `customers`   | Customer info (ID, name, contact, location) |
| `restaurants` | Restaurant data (cuisine, rating, etc.)     |
| `riders`      | Rider details (vehicle type, contact)       |
| `delivery`    | Delivery assignments, linked to riders      |
| `orders`      | Order facts with customer, payment, status  |

## Data Handling & NULL Cleanup

```sql
-- Insert dummy deliverers with missing rider_id

INSERT INTO delivery (deliverer_id) VALUES ('DEL4150'), ('DEL4151'), ('DEL4152');

-- Count nulls
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM delivery WHERE rider_id IS NULL;

-- Delete rows with missing FK
DELETE FROM delivery WHERE rider_id IS NULL;

```
